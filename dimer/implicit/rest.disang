  ! define the shape of the restraint:
  ! the violation energy is a well with a square bottom between r2 and r3
  ! with parabolic sides out to a defined distance 
  ! (r1 and r4 for lower and upper bounds, respectively) 
  ! and linear sides beyond that distance
  ! using original 20Å + 2 * RoG (RoG = ~25Å) = 70Å
